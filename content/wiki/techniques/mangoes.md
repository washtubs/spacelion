Let them ripen on the counter before putting them in the fridge

General idea is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yE0NGXZ_HBs).

Have a bowl for your scraps

1. Cut a base so you can hold it steady, opposite end of the stem
2. Cut the fattest cheek you can make, curving around the pit as you hit it, 90% down, so it's easy to start the other side
3. Score the cheeks, 3x4
4. Expose the chunks without breaking the skin
5. Push your fingers under the chunks
6. Two additional cuts can be made along the sides of the pit
7. The skins and the pits are chef scraps
